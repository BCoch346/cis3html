	<h3>Tips for Executive Success</h3>
	<h4>Funding</span></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Apply for SAMRU E-Awards. You can win $500 for the club every year! Always quantify your efforts and accomplishments for the year and keep them in a word document that can easily be converted into an application letter for the scholarship.</li>
	<li>Speak to past executives to find out who can provide funding for events.</li>
	<li>Piggy back on other events to reduce event costs (career services will often have events in which they have a budget for).</li>
</ul>
	<h4>Documentation</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Always keep the Annual Report in mind. Filling it as you go may assist in making it less of a headache for you when it becomes due in April.</li>
	<li>Always keep a very good record of cash inflows and outflows. It's very important because in the Annual Report, you'll need to balance the clubs' books!</li>
	<li>Always fill out event forms.</li>
	<li>You're going to need to get signatures... A lot!</li>
