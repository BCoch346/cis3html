<h4>Elections</h4>

<h3>Article VI</h3>
<h4>Meetings</h4>

Meetings shall be held once per month. An appropriate date in the month will be determined once class schedules have been determined. Meetings are to be held as early in the month as possible. At least two of the Executive Officers must be present to reach quorum. Meeting minutes will be gathered by at least one member. Minutes then are made available to the general membership via electronic means (i.e. website or email).

<h3>Article VII</h3>
<h4>Impeachment</h4>
<b>State the procedures and majority vote required to impeach an Executive Officer and / or a member.</b>

A member who knowingly violates any provisions of the Constitution or acts in a manner that puts the CISSS in disrepute may be subject to expulsion. The erring member shall be duly informed of their offence and be allowed proper self-defence through oral or written submissions.

Members who fail to perform the duties of their executive roles, consistently evade required meetings, or simply do not contribute to their position may be asked to step down from said position. Failure to negotiate an inactive executive’s status may remit to Article VIII, and successful dissolution of that executive position may result in an appointment or by-election, performed by standing executive members.

Any member can be impeached if 6 or more of the active membership/ Executive Officers give written request to a single member who will serve as the impeachment sponsor.

<h3>Article X</h3>
<h4>Property</h4>
<b>State the procedures for purchases, use, and disposal of club property.</b>

Purchases of club property must first be approved by the treasurer, then by the vice-president, and then the president.

Resources, materials, articles and devices donated to the club become club property in perpetuity, unless specific agreements with the donor are produced in written form as to the term of release for the above elements. Resources which are donated ‘on loan’ become the property of the original donor or their designate at the culmination of the term, and no resources, permanent or temporary, may become property of a club member or executive unless they are the original donor.

Articles and resources which have outlived their useful life expectancy (1 full term before consideration) may be proposed by the club executive through the treasurer for liquidation sale, to which club members are given a priority option to bid on the article. While baseline starting bids and bottom lines may be generated for these articles, a public window of auction must be made available through all channels to active club members before liquidation of a club resource deemed out of date may take place. No fixed point of upper value may be established, and as such auctioned items cannot simply be ‘bought out’ before the auction window is closed. All active members are eligible to bid on legal liquidations, including alumni.

Any club-branded articles, such as hoodies, promotional materials, or other equivalent articles developed through direct club fundraising or budgeted moneys must be properly documented with the club as to purchase price, sale price, margin and profitability. Acquisition and sale of these articles should be performed through the treasurer, and a catalogue of available branded material should be retained for reference.

Use and disposal of club property must be a unanimous decision between all executive officers.
